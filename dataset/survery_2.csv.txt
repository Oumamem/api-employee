Mainframe - PC - Servers - distributed processing - cloud ->...  so, while you hone your 'cloud' skills, be on the lookout for the next half of the loop, whatever it may be... And since 'cloud' is a commodity, companies are starting to look at IT as a commodity... again, part of the never-ending cycle of in-house <--> outsource. This is sometimes associated with the cycle of work from home vs office.

With the rise of agile development, I can also see the probability of the ""Project Manager"" role being devalued. Individual groups will be ""empowered"" to make their own decisions so they will be self-directed. This would make groups more responsive and save companies money. Probably a false economy that will die after a while, but I can easily see it becoming a trend.",Male,"flexibility (both in location and abilities), IT security, cloud, task/project management ",No - never did one
